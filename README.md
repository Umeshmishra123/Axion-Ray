Assignment Analysis

This repository contains the analysis and insights derived from a dataset as part of an assignment. The project involves identifying critical data columns, generating meaningful features from free-text fields, and summarizing insights for stakeholders.

Project Structure

Dataset: The dataset used for this analysis is included as Task 2.xlsx.

Scripts: Python scripts for data processing, visualization, and insights generation.

Results: Generated visualizations and insights from the analysis.

Objectives

Identifying Critical Columns:

Select top 5 columns that provide significant insights.

Justify the choice of columns based on their importance to stakeholders.

Generate at least 3 visualizations to represent these insights.

Generating Tags/Features from Free Text:

Extract meaningful tags from the free-text fields, summarizing key themes.

Examples include identifying failure conditions or components.

Summary and Insights:

Write a summary of tags generated and the potential insights derived.

Provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders.

Highlight any discrepancies in the dataset (e.g., null values, missing keys) and how they were addressed.

Key Findings

Trend Analysis: Repair activity trends over time revealed peaks requiring resource allocation.

Cost Analysis: Insights into repair costs provided clarity on high-cost incidents.

Text Analysis: Generated tags highlighted recurring issues and common resolutions.

Recommendations

Monitor peak repair periods to allocate resources effectively.

Investigate recurring high-cost repairs for potential cost-saving measures.

Enhance customer support based on recurring complaints and resolutions.

Discrepancies and Approach

Null Values: Managed using imputation and filtering techniques.

Missing Keys: Ensured data integrity by verifying primary keys where applicable.
